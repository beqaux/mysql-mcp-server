# MCP Server for Read-Only MySQL Access: Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides read-only access and schema inspection for a MySQL database.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Choose programming language and MCP SDK (TypeScript)
- [ ] Set up project structure and version control
- [ ] Install MCP SDK and MySQL client libraries

## 2. MCP Server Skeleton
- [ ] Initialize a basic MCP server using the chosen SDK
- [ ] Implement server registration and health check endpoints

## 3. MySQL Connection (Read-Only)
- [ ] Configure secure, read-only MySQL connection
- [ ] Add configuration for database credentials (env vars or config file)
- [ ] Test connection to MySQL instance

## 4. Schema Inspection Endpoints
- [ ] Implement endpoint to list databases
- [ ] Implement endpoint to list tables in a database
- [ ] Implement endpoint to inspect table schema (columns, types, indexes)

## 5. Read-Only Query Execution
- [ ] Implement endpoint to execute safe SELECT queries
- [ ] Validate queries to prevent writes (block INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- [ ] Add query result formatting (rows, columns, types)

## 6. MCP Protocol Compliance
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints conform to MCP specification
- [ ] Add required metadata and error handling

## 7. Security & Permissions
- [ ] Enforce read-only access at both MySQL and server level
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all inputs
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for each endpoint
- [ ] Integration tests with a test MySQL database
- [ ] Protocol compliance tests

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Write usage instructions (README)
- [ ] Document API endpoints and MCP integration
- [ ] Add example configuration files

## 10. Deployment & Maintenance
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (Dockerfile, deployment scripts, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD (optional)
- [ ] Plan for updates and maintenance
